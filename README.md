# ChowderCraft

## Features
Makes so every block texture is projected on-screen with a fixed position instead of just being at the block's location, this makes the same effect as Chowder's clothes from the cartoon named... well, *Chowder*

The size of the blocks can be changed in the shader settings, alongside with another option that causes complete chaos :)

## Installation
1. Click on the green **`Code`** button at the top right of the files and then **`Download ZIP`**
2. Move the ZIP file to your **`shaderpacks`** folder inside your **`.minecraft`** (you need **[Iris](https://www.irisshaders.dev/)** or **[Optifine](https://optifine.net/home)** installed)
3. Apply the shader in-game and done :D

## Issues
The following issues are known (anyone with more knowledge than me feel free to make a pull request to fix them):
 - Blocks with tints (Grass, Leaves, Water, Redstone Dust, etc) appear gray as their block tint is not being passed and applied to the on-screen texture
 - Blocks which already have an on-screen texture (End Portals and End Gateways) are broken
 - The text of signs is completely broken

If you find more issues, just report them here

I will try to fix all these issues when I have time :)
